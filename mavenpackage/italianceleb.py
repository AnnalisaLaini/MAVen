from holidaysimport import dtvnt

'''
The italianceleb function tells whether an event is or not an Italian holiday.
Provided some valid holiday names, it tells if Italians celebrate them.
NOTE: The holidays celebrated by Italians are those in the dtvnt dict.
The dtvnt dictionary lists Italian holidays as values.
The function checks for eventsâ€™ presence in the dtvnt values.
If an input event is present, then it is considered as an Italian holiday.
Otherwise, the function does not recognize it as such.
